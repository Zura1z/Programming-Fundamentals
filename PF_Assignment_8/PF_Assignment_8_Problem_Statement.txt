Assignment Statement: Write a program that generates a random walk across a n×m array
where n and m are given as command line arguments. The array will contain characters (all
’.’ initially). The program must randomly walk from element to element, always going up,
down, left, or right by one element (NOT diagonally). The elements visited by the program will
be labeled with the letters A through Z, in the order visited. Here’s an example of the desired
output for the command ./randwalk 12 15:

. . . . . . . X Y . . . . . .
. . . . . . . W Z . . . . . .
. . . . . . . V U . . . . . .
. . . . . . R S T . . . . . .
. . . . . . Q . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . P O N . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . M . . B A . .
. . . . . . . . L K . C . . .
. . . . . . . . I J E D . . .
. . . . . . . . H G F . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Completed ’A’ through ’Z’

Hint: Use the srand and rand functions to generate random numbers. After generating a
number, look at its remainder when divided by 4. There are four possible values for the remainder
(0, 1, 2, and 3) indicating the direction of the next move. Before performing a move, check that
(a) it won’t go outside the array, and (b) it doesn’t take us to an element that already has
a letter assigned. If either condition is violated, try moving in another direction. If all four
directions are blocked, the program must terminate.

Here is another example of a completed termination for ./randwalk 7 9:
. . . . T S R O N
. . . . U . Q P M
. . . . V . H I L
. . . . W Z G J K
. . . . X Y F E D
. . . . . . . . C
. . . . . . . A B
Completed ’A’ through ’Z’
Here’s an example of a premature termination ./randwalk 5 7:
. . K L C B A
. . J M D . .
. . I N E . .
. . H G F . .
. . . . . . .
The letter N got trapped!

Y is blocked on all four sides, so there’s no place to put Z.

Approach: Divide the program into parts. Complete and test each part before moving on.

Divide the program up into methods to provide a structured solution. Some of the methods will
be void and others will return values. You will have to make use of parameters, for loops, while
loops, and if statements. Do not write all your code in main().
