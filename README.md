The best way to use this repository
1- Watch a video on Youtube regarding particular subject

3- After attempting lab tasks, do PF Core subject assignment regarding the topic yourself
4- Compare your solution with my solution
5- After completing Labs and all Assignments, go for the PF Lab Project
6- Compare your solution with my solution
7- Congratulations! You now have mastered Programming Fundamentals :)
