# Programming-Fundamentals
This is a repository of my semester assessments from my 1st semester. The code in all the assignments and tasks is in C. This repository will be very useful for people who starting out with programming.

There two types of files that you will find here:
1-PF core subject assignments
2-PF Lab files

The best way to use this repository
   - Watch a video on Youtube regarding particular subject
   - Do Lab tasks regarding the topic yourself and check my answer and compare with my answer as well
   - After attempting lab tasks, do PF Core subject assignment regarding the topic yourself
   - Compare your solution with my solution
   - After completing Labs and all Assignments, go for the PF Lab Project
   - Compare your solution with my solution
   - Congratulations! You now have mastered Programming Fundamentals :)
