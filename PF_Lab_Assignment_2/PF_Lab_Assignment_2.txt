Write a C program to solve a given series:
1 11 21 1211 1231 131221 132231 ...
In this series, each number explains its previous number, this series may
be read as:
One one times one two times one one times two and one times one
one time 2 and 3 times one one time 3, 1 time 2 and 2 times 1 ...
You have to find nth term of that series. For example,
When n=3, your answer should be 21,
When n=5, your answer should be 1231,
When n=7, your answer should be 132231 and so on...
Hint:
You have to use double or long datatype to store number. You have to break
previous number by divide and modules operator and find number occurrences
to make next number.
Input: Output:
Enter term you want to find:
7
Enter term you want to find:
3

7th term is 132231

3rd term is 21
